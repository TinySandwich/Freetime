		<Starship chassis="Air Field" company="AGI">
			<desc>The AGI Air Field is a mobile deep space carrier. While its structure is more fragile than most it does come with a large hanger already present. Due to its size and mass it is rather slow but pack with crew.</desc>

		<Starship chassis="Mamba B" company="Ultrend">
			<desc>Master Control: If the bridge is "crewed" by non-auto crew, than every station aboard the Starship may activate, even if they are not "crewed."
			
			While the Mamba comes standard with an effective array of armaments, perhaps that's not enough. The Mamba B is the Starship for you. Equipped with a state of the art turret and additional armor plating, the Mamba B can hold its own against anything the galaxy can throw at you. All without sacrificing the elegance and grace of the Mamba.</desc>
